# Lesson 2.5 Exercises

## Numbers
You have a list of numbers:

```python
numbers = [1, 5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7]
```
Go through and print each one.

## Odd Positioned Numbers
Like the numbers problem, but only print the numbers that are at the odd
positions in the list.

## Odd Numbers
Like the numbers problem, but only print the odd numbers.


## Prices
```python
prices = [12.50, 23.99, 50.00, 23.45, 45.95, 72.50, 100.00]
```
You have a list of the prices of some items. Loop through them and print
them out one by one, with a `$` sign in front of each, like:

```
$12.50
$23.99
$50.00
$23.45
$45.95
$72.50
$100.00
```
## Discounts
Based on the prices problem: everything has been discounted 50% off.
Go through each price and print each reduced price.

## Expensive Items
Like the prices problem, but only print prices that are $50 or greater.

## Expensive after discount
Like the prices problem, but only print prices that are $50 or greater after the
discount.

## Total Price
Total all of the prices.

## Total Savings
Total the amount that would have been saved if someone bought each product
given the 50% discount.

## Total Under Fifty
Total the amount it would have cost someone if they bought everything under
$50 after the discount.


## Total with Quantities
Given the list of prices, same as in the prices problem, plus a matching
list of quantities:

```python
prices = [12.50, 23.99, 50.00, 23.45, 45.95, 72.50, 100.00]
quantities = [1, 5, 10, 7, 20, 4, 10]
```

Each quantity in the quantities list matches the price in the same index
in the prices list.

Now give the grand total if someone were to purchases all of these items at
these quantities.

## If You're Happy and You Know It...

You will print the lyrics to the song: [If You're Happy and You Know it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You%27re_Happy_and_You_Know_It).

You have a list of the ending phrases:

```python
endings = [
  "shout/say, 'Hooray'!",
  "slap your knees!",
  "slap your legs!",
  "turn around!",
  "snap your fingers!",
  "nod your head!",
  "tap your toe!",
  "honk your nose!",
  "pat your head!"
]
```
Iterate through each one in order to print the complete lyrics of the song.


## Hello Folks with Ages
You have a list of names and a matching list of ages:

```python
names = ['Manoush', 'Ram', 'Joshua', 'Marion']
ages = [42, 30, 27, 52]
```
Each age in the ages list matches the name in the corresponding index
in the names list.

Go through and say each person's age. Output should look like:

```
Manoush is 42.
Ram is 30.
Joshua is 27.
Marion is 52.
```
